Network Devices:

NIC Card- Network Interface card: is a device to help the computer communicate with another device. The NIC it contains the hardware address.
It can support a transfer rate of 10,100 to 1000 Mb/s.
There are 2 types of NIC: Wireless NIC, Wired NIC

                   DHCP Discover(It is sent by DHCP Client to server)
             DHCP Offer(Sent by Server to Client)
                          DHCP Request(Sent by client to Server)

*TCP-Transmission Control Protocol- is a connection oriented protocol, reliable, error checking, it provide feedback for the end users and it is very slower to perform.

*UDP-User datagram protocol-Connection less, Unreliable, it's perform faster than TCP, No error Checking, It does not provide any feedback, 


IP: Internet Protocol- IPV4, IPV6

Routing Protocols:
* Static Routing Protocol: is a method in which the administrator manually needs to update or add a network in all the routers.
*It is only suitable for a small networks

*Default Routing Protocol
*Dynamic Routing Protocol: a method in which router learn the network info automatically from the neighbour routers using routing protocols.

  *IGP: It is used to share the routing information within a same autonomous system. *OSPF *ISIS *EIGRP *RIP *IGRP                             
*EGP: which is used to share the route information between different as. *BGP

BGP: It is a open standard protocol, it is designed for huge inter network like internet
slowest routing protocol, Path domain routing protocol.

Tables: Neighbour Table, Database Table, Routing

Config Syntax: router bgp <As>
               network<network id> [mask<subnet mask>]
               neighbour <ip-address> remote-as <as number>

Messages: Open, Keepalive messages, Update, Notification

AS: It is a group of devices in the network that are managed by the a single organization.


OSPF: is a Open Shortest Path First, It is an Interior Gateway Protocol. It is a Link state protocol.
*Uses Multicast Address
*Cost is the Metric used
*Cost Formula cost=10^8/Bandwidth
*Classless Routing protocol that supports VLSM and CIDR
*Supports Equal Cost load Balancing
* Router ID plays an Important role in OSPF.

7 States: Down state, Init, Two way state, Exstart, Exchange, Loading, Full state.

OSPF Area: Backbone area, Transit area

OSPF Router Types: Internal, Backbone, Area Border Router(ABR)

LSA: Link State Advertisement:
Types: Router LSA, Network, Summary, Summary ASBR, AS External, Multicast, Not so stubby area.

VLAN: is Virtual Local area Network
*VLAN is a group of devices , that appear to be working on the same LAN, despite their geographical distribution.
*It can be spread across multiple switches in an network
2 Ranges of VLAN: Normal Range(1 to 1005) Extended range VLAN (1006 to 4096)

Advantages: Flexible and Easy to manage, Easy Administration, Security, Reduced cost

*Trunk Port: An Interface Trunk port allow to carry or pass multiple VLAN traffic to pass through it.
*Generally Trunk ports are used between Switch to switch or switch to Router.



RIP: Routing Information Protocol-Distance vector Routing Protocol

EIGRP-Enhanced interior gateway Routing Protocol: 


Hubs are the Layer 1 ( Physical Layer ) device which will not understand the IP address or the MAC address. It will forward the packet to all other ports expect to the port from where it is received. And this is the major disadvantage is, because HUB doesnot know where the destination is loacated.Due to this there will be collision and queues that leads to delays and packet loss in the network.To overcome this headache, Switch was introduced.

Bridge:

Bridges are Layer 2 ( Data link Layer ) device used to connect to two different network device and provide communication between them. As similar to Hubs, Bridges also broadcast the packet to all other port expect from where it is received; however, Briges Mantains the MAC address table. As soon as new segment is discovered the subsequent traffic will be sent to the descrided recipients.
 

Switches :

Switches are the high speed devices which receives the packet and redirect to the correct destination based on the MAC address learnt from the port. 
Switches are similar to Hubs; however, unlike Hub a switch will learn the MAC address of each port, maintain in its MAC address table. It can sent and receive the packet at the same time with out collision or delays.

Routers:
Routers  are Layer 3 ( Network Layer ) devices that forward the packet from one network to another network. 
For example as like your home router connects your LAN to the internet.



 What is a MAC address? MAC stands for Media Access Control. It’s a unique identifier that is assigned to a network interface card, aka a NIC.

This is what a MAC address looks like 08-00-27-EC-10-61. Its a 48-bit (6-byte) address that is used for layer 2 communication. 

The first thing to note is that unlike IP addresses, which and can be changed, MAC addresses are burnt into NIC buy the manufacture.

A MAC address has 2 sections. The first 24-bits is called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and it identifies the vendor. The last 24-bits is a unique value assigned by the vendor. The result is an address that should be unique in the world.

There are three types of Mac address
Unicast - A unique mac address assigned to an interface
Multicast - An address used to send traffic to a device using a particular application/protocol.
Broadcast - An address that is sent to all devices within a local network.
