linux is a process oriented operating system

It is an Commercial os. It consists of 3 parts:
Kernel
Shell
Programs

OS: Operating system is a system software, that manages the computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. The OS is an interface between the user and computer hardware.
types:
1. desktop os
2. server os
3. mobile os
4. embedded os
5. rtos (real time os)

Types of OS:
===============
Ubuntu, Centos, Fedora
Kernel+GNU is also called as OS.

File System:
=============

A File System is a collection of f/D stored in a define format on the disk is also called as "File/S". Every OS have their own file system.

The File System can be classified into 3 Types:

1.Disk based system: These file systems are used by disks(CD'S,HD,DVD'S,PENDRIVES)
====================
EX:FAT: File Allocation Table 16-bit and 32-bit it is used by windows client and old versions.

NTFS: New Technology File System/ It is used by windows server oS/ Latest Clients

ext2/ext3/ext4/XFS: External File System, These File Systems are used by Linux OS

JFS: Journal File System: It is used by IBM-AIX UNIX

UFS: Unix File System: It is used by Solaris OS

HFS: High Performance File System: It is used by HP-UX

2. Network Based File System: These File Systems are used by Networks.
=============================
DFS: Distributed fs: It is used window servers for sharing the files across the network.

NFS: Network fs: It is used LINUX/UNIX for sharing the date across the network

CIFS: Common Internet fs: It is used by samba server for sharing the resources from Linux to windows environment.

3. Virtual fs: used by memory
=============================
SWAPFS: Swap fs: It is used by Linux as a temporary memory

TMPFS: used by windows/Linux

CACHEFS: used by windows and Linux to improve the performance of servers


Structure of  Linux (/ can be denoted as root)
============================================

/etc- Configuration files location
/bin- the binary executable files or normal user command location
/sbin- The system admin commands location
/lib- The lib files location
/usr- The systems file location
/opt- The third party packages location
/tmp- The temporary files location
/root- Default home directory of root user
/home- Default home " of Linux users
/boot- The bootable files location
/var- The system log files
/media- The removable media location
/mnt- The optional directory to mount other media
/dev- The logical devices names location
/sys- The physical devices names loctaion
/proc-

File Content Commands:
==========================

Head- Is used to diplay the first 10 lines content of a file.

Tail- Is used to similar to the head command, it is display the last 10 lines content of a file. It is useful for reading the error messages.

User Commands:
```````````````
SU- Swtch User- 
======================
Is used to provide administrative access to the another user.
It allow access of the Linux shell to another user.

ID- 
================
is used to display the GID (Group ID), UID (User ID)

Useradd-
============
 is used to the add the user
userdel- 
===========
 remove the user.

Groupadd- 
===============
is used to create a user group.

Passwd-
=========
 is used to change the user password.

sudo passwd username:

echo- is used to print something in the terminal.

wget - is used to 

rename Command:
================
The rename command is used to rename files. It is useful for renaming a large group of files.

how to check the shell by using command;
====================================
echo $SHELL

CURRENT SHELL IN OUR LINUX SERVER:
===============================
ECHO $0

logname (who is the first log into the server.)

whoami 

sudo (super user do)

who -b (check the system boot)

more command
=================
The more command is quite similar to the cat command, as it is used to display the file content in the same way that the cat command does. The only difference between both commands is that, in case of larger files, the more command displays screenful output at a time.

less Command
===============
The less command is similar to the more command. It also includes some extra features such as 'adjustment in width and height of the terminal.

comm Command
============
The 'comm' command is used to compare two files or streams.

sort Command
============
The sort command is used to sort files in alphabetical order.

Grep- it stands for Global regular expression print
=========================================
is used to Most Powerfull and filter in linux, It is useful for searching the content from a file. Generally, it is used with the pipe.

Gzip-
==============
The gzip command is used to truncate the file size. It is a compressing tool. It replaces the original file by the compressed file having '.gz' extension.

Gunzip-
=============
The gunzip command is used to decompress a file. It is a reverse operation of gzip command.

WIN Networking Commands:
===========================

1. IPCONFIG-
The IPCONFIG network command provides a comprehensive view of information regarding the IP address configuration of the device we are currently working on.

The IPConfig command also provides us with some variation in the primary command that targets specific system settings or data, which are:

IPConfig/all - Provides primary output with additional information  about network adapters.
IPConfig/renew - Used to renew the system’s IP address.
IPConfig/release - Removes the system’s current IP address.

2. NSLOOKUP- 
The NSLOOKUP command is used to troubleshoot network connectivity issues in the system. Using the nslookup command, we can access the information related to our system’s DNS server, i.e., domain name and IP address.

3. HOSTNAME
The HOSTNAME command displays the hostname of the system. The hostname command is much easier to use than going into the system settings to search for it.

4. PING: The ping command is used to check the connectivity between two nodes, that is whether the server is connected. It is a short form of "Packet Internet Groper."

5. TRACERT
The TRACERT command is used to trace the route during the transmission of the data packet over to the destination host and also provides us with the “hop” count during transmission.

Using the number of hops and the hop IP address, we can troubleshoot network issues and identify the point of the problem during the transmission of the data packet.

6. NETSTAT
 displays an overview of all the network connections in the device. 

7. ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)
The ARP command is used to access the mapping structure of IP addresses to the MAC address. This provides us with a better understanding of the transmission of packets in the network channel.

8. SYSTEMINFO
we can access the system’s hardware and software details, such as processor data, booting data, Windows version, etc.



Bash shell:
==============
The most commonly-used shell for Linux distributions is called the Bash shell. Bash provides many advanced features, such as command history and inline editing, which allows a user to easily re-execute previously executed commands or a variation of them via simple editing.
Bash has an extensive feature list
types of shells:

ash 
ksh
csh
tcsh


Scripting: 
=============
The ability to place commands in a file and then interpret (effectively use Bash to execute the contents of) the file, resulting in all of the commands being executed. This feature also has some programming features, such as conditional statements and the ability to create functions (AKA subroutines).

Aliases:
=============
 The ability to create short nicknames for longer commands.

What is a command?
====================

a command is a software program that, when executed on the CLI, performs an action on the computer.

Keep in mind that Linux is case-sensitive. Commands, options, arguments, variables, and file names must be entered exactly as shown.

What is PPP in Linux?
========================
PPP, or Point-to-Point Protocol, is a recognized `official' internet protocol. It is a protocol used to exchange IP frames (and others) over a serial link.

What is a SSH command?
======================
SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network. SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol.

Ec2 is stands for elastic cloud computing, it is type of virtual machine.
AMI== amazon machine image
== every ami has a their own identification number is called ami id.
SECURITY GROUP:
it is a virtual firewall at ec2 instance level.
it contains set of rules
every application has their own port number, all ports between 0 to 65535.

ssh 22
http 80 
mysql 3306
rdp -3389
Public ip: ec2 instance login and application send to the enduser to access the app.

Private ip: it is used to internal communication

Pem file== it contains private key


The env:
===========
is used to display all the available variables in the system.
Kernel:
===============
is the core component of the linux os that manages the system software resources.
it  is a heart of the linux os
it acts as an intermediary between applications and the physical hardware of the computer. ensuring efficient and secure operation of the system.

kernel is going to manage the system resources(cpu, memory) as per user request.

crontab command:
=================
What is cron?
- cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It allows users to schedule jobs (commands or scripts) to run automatically at specified times or intervals. These scheduled tasks are called "cron jobs."
Understanding crontab.
- crontab is a configuration file that specifies the schedule of cron jobs for individual users or the system. Each line in a crontab file represents a task and its corresponding schedule.
